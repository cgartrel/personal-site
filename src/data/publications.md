# Determinantal Point Processes

Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) are a class of discrete distributions used for subset selection modeling. DPPs have received growing attention in the machine learning community over the past decade, and have many applications in areas such as reinforcement learning, recommendation systems, language model decoding, document summarizaCon, and minibatch selection.
