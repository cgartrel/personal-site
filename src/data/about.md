I'm an independent AI researcher working on generative AI topics, including large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models. My research interests involve leveraging insights from probablistic modeling approaches to improve LLMs, unifying conventionally disparate classes of generative models such as score-based diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GANs), and enhancing diffusion models and LLMs to enable new applications.

Previously I worked as a senior researcher at the [Criteo AI Lab](https://ailab.criteo.com) in Paris, France, where I pursued research on generative AI, recommender systems, and a class of models for subset selection known as determinantal point processes (DPPs). Prior to Criteo I worked as a post-doc researcher at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/), where I focused on recommender systems and DPPs.
